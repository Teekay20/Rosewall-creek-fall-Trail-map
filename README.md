Rosewall Creek to Therriault Falls – Interactive Trail Map

This project showcases a topographic and interactive web map for the Rosewall Creek to Therriault Falls trail, built using Leaflet and React. The GPX data, sourced from Wikiloc, powers the trail visualization, while interactive features such as waypoints, signage, and trail condition surveys enhance the hiking experience. Additionally, the map supports trail repair and maintenance efforts by highlighting areas needing attention. Here's what it includes:

1. Topographic Map – Displays elevation changes, terrain features, and contour lines, helping hikers plan their route efficiently.

2. GPX Trail Mapping – Processes and visualizes GPX track data for accurate trail path representation.

3. Multi-Layered Basemaps – Integrated multiple basemaps (OpenStreetMap, Google Terrain, Esri Satellite) offering diverse geographic perspectives for enhanced analysis.

4. Interactive Waypoints & Signage – Highlights key trail features, including waterfalls, bridges, steep inclines, and obstacles, with images and elevation data for improved navigation.

5. Legend & Scale Bar – A toggleable legend and an accurate scale bar for enhanced usability and distance measurement.

Significance:
This interactive web map enhances trail navigation and outdoor exploration while supporting data-driven trail maintenance and preservation. By combining topographic data, GPX routes, and interactive waypoints, it aids hikers in planning their journey and helps trail managers identify areas needing repair, ensuring the trail remains safe and sustainable for future use. A vital tool for both adventurers and conservation efforts!
